					<p>Music discovery can be hard, many of us rely on online blogs, recommendations from friends, playlists, FM radio, or whatever tools your music streaming platform of choice offers. Unfortunately these options are often unreliable, repetitive, or aren’t personalized enough, making it harder to find new, underground or exciting artists and songs to fall in love with. This project is an attempt to solve some of these frustrations, by <b>giving users a tool that allows them to customize their different tastes in music, find new (and less mainstream) artists, easily create playlists full of recommendations, and encourage more music sharing.</b></p>
					<p>As a personal project, I was able to focus on a few aspects of UX and product design that I don’t get the opportunities to apply or practice everyday. My main goals were to create a focused and thorough user experience by zeroing in on process, documentation, problem solving, and iteration. This meant spending more time on user flows, functionality and interaction design elements rather than branding, design systems, or aesthetics. <b>The following content is a work in progress, documented and formatted to show thinking and process.</b></p>

					<p>During my research phase, I discovered a number of existing tools to both take inspiration from, and analyse each of their success and failures. <a href="https://magicplaylist.co/" target="_blank">MagicPlaylist</a> for instance, shows exactly how simple playlist generation can be, and <a href="https://musicroamer.com/" target="_blank">MusicRoamer</a> does an excellent job visualizing the relationships between related artists. These sites are <b>interesting tools to use and explore but neither have a comprehensive toolset or a wide offering of different connected services.</b></p>
					<p>I started exploring what a platform would look like that took the best things these tools had to offer and combined them in a way that was cohesive and interconnected. Some simple brainstorming with pen and paper, (as seen above) allowed me to <b>quickly ideate solutions, features, pain points, and interactions.</b> I identified the core functionality that would be necessary for a <b>MVP feature-set including the ability to create and share lists of related artists, an easy tool to generate a playlist based on an artist or list, and a way to view and organize multiple lists.</b> From there I was able to generate a few other features that would both support and help connect the core features, including the ability to view popular lists or artists, preview an artist's work within app, and a tool that would allow users to input detailed likes and dislikes to generate a personalized list of artist recommendations.</p>

					<p>Using these initial concepts as a launching point, I created a rough draft of a <b>user flow map highlighting the different views and interactions</b>. While fairly high-level, this allowed me to quickly and easily understand the scope of the project, and identify which interactions would be needed for each view. This made creating wireframes significantly faster and easier, as I already knew which interactions were needed on each screen, and how they all flowed together. Taking a few of these wireframes, and <b>translating them into full designs with real content allowed me to really test my initial assumptions</b> as well as make some branding and visual design decisions. I also referred to Material Design guidelines, as well as took some inspiration from music streaming apps like Apple Music during this phase to better understand mobile design standards for music apps. <b>This led to a lot of iteration</b>, tweaking colors, font weights, and layouts to better fit both the content and the visual tone I was trying to achieve.</p>

					<p>While <b>the visual style and branding elements are still works-in-progress</b>, there are a few fundamental concepts that will be carried through to the final product. The color palette is calm and welcoming, using warm tones and earthy colors to encourage the user to explore and create. The use of wide font styles, while challenging on smaller screen sizes, brings some personality and charm to the overall look and feel. Finally, the use of drop shadows not only borrows some visual language from popular app design, but is used as another tool to separate content, highlight actionable elements, and support a consistent visual hierarchy of both actions and content alike.</p>

					<p>	This project is very much a work-in-progress, and there are a number of steps, deliverables, and additional features I still plan on exploring and creating. <b>The most important next step is user testing</b>. Now that I’ve explored my assumptions and focused my initial ideas and concepts, it’s time to create a low fidelity interactive prototype to test my work so far with real users. This step will now only be important to improve the user experience but also will give me an opportunity to get some feedback on my initial ideas for branding and visual design elements. </p>

					<p>From a feature perspective, I also plan on exploring the the idea of adding genre tags on artists to help organization and filtering, the ability to search for specific songs as well as artists and how that would impact other features, and finally researching the feasibility of syncing or connecting a user to their accounts on their music streaming services of choice which could open up a number of interesting integration possibilities. Looking at the final visual design deliverables, along with creating a low-fi prototype, as part of my final designs I plan on creating some animated high-fidelity designs to capture some micro-animations/interactions for the last layer of design polish. </p>
