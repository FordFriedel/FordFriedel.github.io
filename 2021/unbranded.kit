					<p>This branding and web design concept was created as part of <b>a pitch for a to-be-released project</b> I worked on with fellow members of the Merck team at Digitas Health. My concept focuses on <b>empowering the user to educate themselves, take action to access more resources, feel confident in their treatment choices,</b> and encourage communication with their medical professionals. This concept was pitched to both an internal team consisting of art directors, UX researchers, and brand strategists, as well as the external client team for feedback.</p>
					<p>There were a few key ideas and terms that guided and directed the design decisions on this project such as <b>'empowering action' and 'calmly confident'</b>. The color choices reflect those ideas through a strong and trustworthy navy blue, a supportive orange, a calming green and a handful of soft accent colors. Extensive typography research was conducted to align on the highly legible, friendly and flexible Work Sans for body copy, and a bold headline typeface in Raleway that has just the right amount of character.</p>

					<p>Below are some <b>early wireframes that explore layout options, section hierarchy, and interactive elements</b>. These were built from the ground-up to explore early design and content assumptions, with an emphasis on visual spacing, content hierarchy, and guiding the user's focus. After these initial ideas were distilled, these wireframes were reviewed and approved by a senior UX researcher.</p>
					<p>Extensive work was completed for the design explorations and iterations based on internal feedback and during client review sessions. <b>This work can be shared upon request</b> and includes dozens of artboards exploring hierarchy, typography styles, color variations, background elements, white-space usage, layout, copy edits, button styles, component design, navigation, icon usage, and interactive elements. </p>
