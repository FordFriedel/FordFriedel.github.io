					<p>The collection and analysis of sports data has been around for decades, measuring and interpreting the performances of both players and teams, in an attempt to quantify successes and failures. The creation and growth of organized esports over the past 20 years, however, has opened the doors to collect immense amounts of performance data that our traditional analysis methods and standards are ill-equipped to handle.</p>
					<p>This project is an attempt to <b>re-contextualize and improve the visual communication of esports data</b> and statistics from my current favorite esport, the Overwatch League (or OWL). As a highly complex and team-oriented game, understanding the data from matches can be confusing and misleading as player or team performance can be easily misunderstood depending on the match-up, the characters played, the map type, or the current popular playstyle (or meta). As a big fan of the league and a former high-ranked player of the game myself, I wanted to <b>explore how these complicated and detailed stats could be used to support analytical arguments</b> as well as practice my UI design skills and data visualization best practices on a web-app platform.</p>

					<p>I looked at similar websites across different esports titles such as <a href="https://na.op.gg/aram/aatrox/statistics" target="_blank">League of Legends</a>,<a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats" target="_blank">CS:GO</a>, and <a href="https://www.valorbuff.com/stats" target="_blank"> Valorant</a>, as well as traditional sports with sites such as <a href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_blank">ESPN</a>. These sites gave me a lot of insight and inspiration into different methods of organizing and balancing content that is technical or dense. In particular, <b>strong typographic hierarchy paired with either eye-catching data visualization</b> or icons were the most successful at providing easy-to-understand context to numbers or data points that would otherwise be difficult to quickly understand. These types of visual treatments helped <b>guide users through each statistic, while also making the layouts scannable and easy to navigate.</b></p>
					<p>I dived deep into exploring the data that was available to me on the league's website in their <b><a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab" target="_blank"> Stats Lab</a>, a series of Tableau views highlighting and presenting different parts of the data</b> collected from team performance metrics to player statistics. A few of these pages are simple data charts tying performance stats to specific heroes, players, maps and matches with filter options, while others are more complex, such as one that displays specific team composition matchups over certain time periods. These views, created by <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainPlanetOW">Ben Trautman</a>, OWL’s in-house stat wizard, reveal the breadth and complexity of data involved. With more than 300 different statistics captured during live matches the views are <b>focused on supporting the production of the OWL broadcast</b>, and their analyst segments, rather than the average fan. This means the views don’t need very much context, as the analysts and hosts include that in the broadcast themselves, and are often used to simply compare two players or teams to support the storylines and narratives of the league. While the Stats Lab is successful in this use, <b>the overall presentation isn’t very useful, or easy to understand</b>, to most fans.</p>

					<p>Based on the above research, I identified the biggest issues with the current Stats Lab experience, and gathered a few solutions based on other statistics sites I viewed. The current experience does a fantastic job of handling the sheer quantity of data and supporting the statistics used in the OWL broadcast, but the core platform is not very user-friendly, and the different views are confusing and overwhelming to first-time viewers. It can be difficult to navigate, with unclear labels and a lack of descriptive language. Along with long load times from the Tableau embed, awkward controls, many large tables of data with no clear visual hierarchies, and confusing filter options, the overall experience creates a steep learning curve.</p>
					<p>Identifying these problems helped me establish three core concepts to center this project around - <b>time, context and ease-of-use</b>. Designing for time is necessary to capture the ever-changing landscape of the game and league, playstyle and strategies change constantly as the game is updated, and it’s important to be able to track that via stats, whether through team oriented metrics or individual performance numbers over time. This type of comparison, when combined with the third idea of adding context, the most important of the three, helps provide the viewer a deeper understanding of the statistic they are viewing. In such a fluid, complex, and team oriented game, it is <b>essential that viewers understand the background and circumstances behind a data point</b>, whether comparing individual players, viewing trends over a certain period or time, or trying to identify a certain playstyle. Finally, an overall <b>emphasis on ease-of-use, through clear navigation, filtering options, and organizational details</b>, allows the user to find the data they are looking for and avoid frustration.</p>

					<p><b>The design process for this project mainly revolved around iteration</b>. As a personal project, and an opportunity to practice and refine some UI and data visualization skills, I felt comfortable fleshing out initial ideas to test and analyze successes and failures. I’ve embedded a figma file above to show some of the process. As seen on the homepage iterations, <b>many of my first attempts felt like long repetitive lists and tables full of data but lacking meaning and context</b>. Separating filtering options into different sections felt like the right decision at first, to suggest a hierarchy of choices, but after designing and testing it, it became clear that was incorrect, as filter options should be grouped and treated equally. This iterative approach applied to most design decisions, from color palette to button styling, allowing me to practice and learn, while evolving the overall design. </p>
					<p><b>Creating the data vis elements was tricky at first</b>, I took a lot of inspiration from similar sites, and worked through what types of improvements could be made to fit particular data sets as well as remain technically feasible. It was <b>important to recognize which types of data necessitated a visualization and which didn’t</b>. Percentages could be paired with a simple bar if needed, but other data points such as rankings compared to other players needed a different solution. Some stats didn’t need a visualization at all.</p>
