					<p>As one of the biggest cancer treatment drugs on the market, it was necessary for the web experience of the consumer-facing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180823174426/https://www.keytruda.com/" target="_blank">Keytruda.com</a> to be updated to modern standards with iteration and flexibility in mind. The <b>existing experience was not responsive nor accessible, had confusing navigation menus, and wasn’t built with future expansion in mind</b>. The brand had also quickly evolved since 2017 when this version was launched, with an ever expanding list of indications (now over 25), countless projects evolving the visual style, and a growing agency team (now over 120 members).</p>
					<p>These problems were the focus when I first joined the Merck team at Digitas Health and began working on the redesign of Keytruda.com with a large team that included an art director, another designer, three UX experts, and multiple project managers, copywriters, and developers. I had joined after preliminary UX research had been completed, early designs had been explored and a general look and feel had been approved by the client team, and  <b>with my past experiences I was able to perfectly fill the role of creating and maintaining the design system and component library</b>.</p>

					<p>At a technical level, much of my early work on this project was organizing the existing work completed on the project, such as typeface, colors and other base-level elements, into logical groups, <b>establishing a naming convention, and creating all of the necessary design tokens needed to establish the visual consistency</b> of the web pages and components. </p>
					<p>Leveraging Sketch, and it’s Symbol Library features, I was then able to <b>explore, design and iterate the necessary components</b> working alongside a creative director and a copywriter, with continued input from our UX experts to ensure each element <b>met the necessary standards and requirements from usability, brand style, and content</b>. These components included a set of extensively reworked and redesigning data visualization components, user-friendly global navigation, content callouts and CTAs, brand-infused page heroes, new visual structure for the legally-required safety information elements, and new UX-focused sign up forms & fields.</p>

					<p>Our system was based on <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">Brad Frost’s Atomic Design</a>, with the <b>greatest focus on the base-level atoms, and larger-scope organisms (or components)</b>. This allowed for a high level of flexibility when creating and iterating new components, and clear rules and toolset when creating page designs and content. Having a simple naming structure and consistent methodology both internal decision-making and communication with our developers and copywriters easier and more efficient when building out dozens of pages within short timeframes. <b>Significant focus was also given to flexibility and future-proofing our designs</b>, allowing for new content to be built, expanded and improved in the future as both the website and brand grow.</p>
					<p>In the end, the final system included a brand-new icon set, 20+ desktop and mobile page templates, and around two dozen finalized Sketch symbols for every component and element. Much of this work would also be organized and documented further in an Invision DSM project for internal reference and visibility.</p>

					<p>Other projects I worked on related to this style library:</p>
					<p><a href="https://www.keytrudalenvima.com/advanced-endometrial-cancer/" target="_blank"><b>Keytruda + Lenvima</a> is a website based off of the KEY Style Library which is used to promote a different use of the Keytruda immunotherapy</b>. While built off of the existing groundwork and guidelines, this project had its own challenges as we had to include standards and styles from another brand and meet an appropriate balance between the two, as well as collaborate with a new group of stakeholders. This involved creating new components, alternate versions of existing elements and tackling new UX challenges.</p>

					<p><a href="https://www.keytruda.com/getting-started/" target="_blank"><b>Digital Quick Start Guide</a> is a short and direct summary of the most important content found on the Keytruda site.</b> One of the first new pieces of content for the site, this project was a new UI and UX challenge that allowed us to explore new ways to expand the style guide and test new ways to present user-friendly content.</p>

					<p><b>Keytruda Chatbot is a chatbot created to assist users on the website and help navigate them to the content they are searching for.</b> I was pulled in to help explore and iterate on a visual style for the chatbot UI that would follow the visual style of the site, while also keeping in line with the limitations of the pre-built software we were leveraging.</p>
